vsuite
======

vsuite is a project management suite for Linux OSes aimed at writers who want
tools that help--rather than hinder--them in their writing. At its core, it is
a wrapper around various technologies that makes it easy to do your writing in
`markdown <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-8.html>`_ files that can easily
be turned into finished final documents. Writing in markdown allows the writer,
once she is up-to-speed on its usage, to separate the conceptually-distinct
tasks of writing and typesetting in a manner largely inspired by `this
<http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/wp.html>`_ `essay
<https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/wp.html>`_.
Take a look at the following workflow diagram and `this demo
<https://asciinema.org/a/162560>`_ to see if you might benefit from using this
software.
